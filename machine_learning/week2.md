# Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
* Variables represent the features used in a prediction.

#### New Hypothesis Function
* h(x) = \theta0 + \theta1 * x1 + ... + \thetaN * xN
  * x = vector[x0, x1, ... xN] for real numbers from 0 to N + 1
  * \theta = vector[\theta0, \theta1, ... \thetaN] for real numbers from 0 to N + 1
* h(x) = \theta<sup>T</sup> * x
