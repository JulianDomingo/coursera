# Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
* Variables represent the features used in a prediction.

#### New Hypothesis Function
* h(x) = \theta	0 + \theta	1 * x1 + ... + \theta	N * xN
  * x = vector[x0, x1, ... xN] for real numbers from 0 to N + 1
  * \theta	 = vector[\theta	0, \theta	1, ... \theta	N] for real numbers from 0 to N + 1
* h(x) = \theta	<sup>T</sup> * x
