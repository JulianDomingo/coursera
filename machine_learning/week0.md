### Supervised Learning

__Example__: Housing price prediction. 
* Choosing straight line or quadratic to data set to accurately determine house price.
* __Regression Model__: map input variables to some continuous function. 

__Example 1__: Breast Cancer (malignant or benign?)
* Data set contains benign (vertical value == 0) and malignant (== 1) points.
* __Classification Model__: map input variables into discrete categories (discrete valued output (Map values to classifications)).

Supervised learning:
* "Right" answers are given in data sets.
* Already know what our correct output should look like, knowing there is a relationship between input and output.
* Categorized into 2 problems listed above (regression / classification models).
